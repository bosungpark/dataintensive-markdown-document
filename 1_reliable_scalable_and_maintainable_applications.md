Many applications today are data-intensive, as opposed to compute-intensive.

Reliability
=
fault-tolerant or resilient.
a fault is usally defined as one component of the system deviating from its spec, whereas a failure is when the system as a whole stops providing the required service to the user.

Although we generally preper toleratingg faults over preventing faults. there are cases where preventation is better than cure. especially when involves security matters.

Hardware Fault
=
until recently, redundancy of hardware components was sufficient for most applications. however, as data volumns and application's computing demands have increased, more applications have begun using larger numbers of machines.

Hence there is a move toward systems that can tolerate the loss of entire machines. using software fault-tolerance techiques in preference or in addition to hardware redundancy. such sustems also have operational advantages.

Software Errors
=

Human Error
=

Scalability
=
Scalabilty is the term we use to describe a sysrm's ability to cope with increased load.

High percentiles of respons times, also known as tail latencies, are important. because they directly affect user's experience of service. if data is big, queries became slow, that means user purchased many items.

Queueing delays often account for a large part of the response time at high percentiles.

Maintainability
=
It is well known that the majority of the cost of software is not in its initial development, but in its ongoing mainenance.
